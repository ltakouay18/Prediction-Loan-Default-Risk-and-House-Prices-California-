- As of the fourth quarter of 2022, the residential morgage debt totaled approximately $11.92 trillion in the U.S. The increasing cost of owning real estate, the rise of short term rentals and slow growth in job openings and salary raises is leaving many Americans with a bleak outlook on their ability to one day purchase a home. It is common for new homeowners to purchase a home with a down payment and take out a mortgage or other loan to finance their residence. Various Financial Insititutions provide such loans, but in this project we will utilize data from LendingClub Financial Services and from open source kaggle datasets on salaries in the U.S. and california real estate prices.

We will tackle a real business problem in helping clients understand factors that determine whether they get accepted for specific loan amounts. This can enable them to adjust their short term and long term financial goals. The problem is solved using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns of the data and Machince Learning for Classification and Regression/Prediction. This project also allows to understand risk analysis in financial services and how institutions utilize data to chose appropriate clients and minimize losses.

- The analysis is performed using a variety of datasets and is divided into three parts:

Exploratory Data Analysis
Classification Machine Learning: Fully Paid/or Charged Off on Loan
Prediction Machnine Learning on a Time Series: Future housing prices in California
The analysis, training and testing will be performed on subsets of data from the California housing market. This is to provide a targeted customer segment details about patterns within the state and it will provide reduced running times compared to training on datasets that cover the entire nation. Additionally, the models built can be applied to other datasets by adjusting hyperparameters.
